        <li>The programmer must “manually” manage the movement of data items between and among memory locations and registers (although such data items can be assigned pneumonic names.)</li>
        <li>The programmer must take a microscopic view of a task, breaking it down into tiny subtasks -ADD, COMPARE, INCREMENT - that direct what is going on in individual memory locations and registers.</li>
        <li>An assembly language program is machine specific.</li>
        <li>Statements are not natural -language- like (although operations are given pneumonic code words as an improvement over a string of bits.)</li>

    <li>The programmer need not manage the details of the movement of data items within memory or pay any attention to exactly where those items are stored.</li>

     <li>Programs are portable rather than machine specific.</li>

        <li>Procedural Language: s a type of computer programming language that specifies a series of well-structured steps and procedures within its programming context to compose a program.
             It contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to complete a computational task or program.</li>
        <li>Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE):The IDE lets the programmer perform a number of tasks within the shell of a single application program, rather than having to use a separate program for each task.</li>
        <li>Software Development Life Cycle: The overal  sequence of steps needed to complete a large-scale software project.</li>
        <li>Waterfall Model of Software Development:is a breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases, meaning they are passed down onto each other, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks.</li>

                     <li>Testing: checks to see if a program produces correct answers 100% of the time and will work on all data.</li>
                     <li>Verification:Can be used to prove that if the input data to a program satisfies certain conditions, then, after the program has been run on this data, the output data satisfies certain other conditions.</li>
