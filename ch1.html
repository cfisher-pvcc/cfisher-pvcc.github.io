<td><ol>
    <li>Computer Science: The study of Algorithms, including their formal mathematical properties, their hardware realization ,their linguistic realizations and their applications.</li>
        <li>Algorithm: A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves repetition of an operation; broadly: a step by step method of accomplishing a task.</li>
         <li>Sequential operation: A Sequential instruction carries out a single well-defined task. When that task is finished, the algorithm moves on to the next operation. Sequential operations are usually expressed as simple declarative sentences.</li>
        <li>Conditional Operation: These are the "question-asking" instructions of an algorithm. They ask a question, and the next operation is then selected on the basis of the answer to that question.</li>
         <li>Iterative Operation: These are "looping" instructions of an algorithm. They tell us not to go on to the next instruction but, instead, to go back and repeat the execution of a previous black of instructions.</li>
        <li>Programmer: A person who writes computer programs.</li>
        <li>Integrated Circuit: An electronic circuit formed on a small piece of semiconducting material, performing the same function as a larger circuit made from discrete components.</li>

<td><ol>
    <li>First Generation Computer: They were the first commercial computers. They were the first symbolic programming languages
        . They used binary arithmetic,vacuum tubes for storage. They punched card input/output. </li>
        <li> Second Generation Computer: They had transistors and core memories. They had the first disks for mass storage.
            They had a size reduction, increased reliability and lower costs. They had the first higher- level programming languages.
            They were the first operating systems.</li>
        <li> Third Generation Computer: They had integrated circuits. They had a further reduction is size, cost and increased reliability.
                They were the first mini computers. They had time-shared operating systems. They were the first appearance of the software industry.
                They were the first set of computing standards for compatibility between systems.</li>
        <li> Fourth Generation Computer: They had large-scale and very-large-scale integrated circuits. They were some of the first mini computers.
                    They had a further reduction is size, cost and increased reliability. They provided growth of new types of software and of the software industry.
                    They had computer networks and graphical user interfaces. </li>
        <li> Fifth Generation Computer: They have ultra-large integrated circuits. They have supercomputers and parallel processors.
                        They are laptops, tablets, smartphones and handhels wireless devices. They have mobile computing and massive external data storage devices.
                    They have ubiquitous computing. They have high-resolution graphics, visualization and virtual reality. They have worldwide networks and cloud computing.
                They have multimedia user interfaces and widespread use of digitized sound, images and movies. </li>
