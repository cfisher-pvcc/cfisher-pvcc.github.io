        <li> Infomration Security: Means protecting data from those who do not have permission to access it. </li>
        <li> Authentication:Is the process of verifying that you really are the person who has right to access a particular device, whether it is your local machine or the remote server.</li>
        <li> Authorization:Governs what an authenticated user is allowed to do.</li>
        <li> Dual Authentication:a security system that requires two separate, distinct forms of identification in order to access something.</li>
        <li> Social Engineering: refers to all techniques aimed at talking a target into revealing specific information or performing a specific action for illegitimate reasons.</li>
        <li> Virus:Is a computer program that, like a biological virus, infects a host computer and then spreads.</li>
        <li>Worm:Is very similar to a virus, but it can send copies of itself to other nodes on a computer network without having to be carried by an infected host file.</li>
        <li> Trojan Horse:Is a computer program that does some legitimate computational task but also, unbeknownst to the user, contains code
             to perform the same kinds of malicious attacks as viruses and worms-corrupt or delete files, slow down the computer, and the like.</li>
        <li> Ransomware:Invades the user’s computer, often by means of an infected email attachment. It then encrypts files on the computer, usually with the 
            strong enough encryption algorithm that only the author of the malware software, who holds the decryption key, can unlock the files.</li>
        <li> Phishing: the fraudulent practice of sending emails or other messages purporting to be 
            from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.</li>
        <li> White Hat: Are the security experts who try to keep us safe and cyberspace. </li>
        <li> Black Hat:Are the bad guys who try to fared out computer system weaknesses for financial gain, control, or outright destruction.</li>
        <li> Encryption/Decryption:Encryption is the process of using an algorithm to convert information into a representation that cannot be
             understood or utilized by anyone without the appropriate decryption algorithm. Decryption is the reverse of encryption, using the algorithm that converts the ciphertext back into plain text.</li>
        <li> Cryptography:is the science of :secret writing".</li>
        <li> Symetric Encryption Algorithm:Requires the use of a secret key known to both the sender and the receiver. The sender encrypts
             the plain text using the key. The receiver, knowing the key, is easily able to reverse the process and decrypt the message.</li>
        <li>Caesar Cipher: Is called a shift cipher, involves shifting each character in the message to another character some fixed distance farther along in the alphabet.</li>
        <li> Block cipher:A group or block of plaintext letters gets encoded into a block of cipher text But not by substituting 1 character at a time for each letter.</li>
        <li> Data Encryption Standard (DES): Is the encryption algorithm developed by IBM in the 1970s for the US National Bureau of standards and is certified as an international standard by the
             international organization for standardized nation. DES was designed to protect electronic information, so that plain text is a binary string of zeros and ones, just as it is stored in a computer.</li>
        <li> Public Key System: a large numerical value that is used to encrypt data.</li>
        <li> Embedded Computer:Are computation devices such as chips, processors, or computers that are embedded within another system.</li>

                        <li> Easy Ciphers Game: I played the Caeser cipher. I was given an encrypted message and a cipher. To decrypt the message, I had to find the encryped letter on the inner circle of the cipher to find the decryped letter on the outer circle. </li>
                        <li> Normal Ciphers Game: I played the Polybius Square Cipher.  I was given an encrypted message and a table. To decrypt the message, I had to to use the table. Each letter is made up of two numbers, the first being the row it is in and the second being the column it is in.</li>
                        <li> Hard Ciphers Game: I played the Columnar Transposition Cipher.I was given an encrypted message and a keyword. To decrypt the message, the I needed to take the key word, write it out, and letter each number it according to its alphabetic order.
                            In the encrypted message given, the number of groups of letters represents how long the keyword is and the number of letters in each groups represents the number of columns. Take each group out of numerical and put it in order according to the way the keyword is spelled.</li>
