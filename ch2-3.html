        <li> Explain why natural language is not an effective tool for describing algorthims: Natural language can be extremely verbose, causing the resulting algorithms to be rambling, unstructered and hard to follow.</li>
        <li> Problem 1: A student has three grades; the final grade is the average of the three. List the algorithmic steps to find the final grade.: You would add the three grades together and divide by three to get the average grade.
        <li> A car owner recorded the car's previous mileage, current mileage, and the number of gallins of gas the owner filled their tank with. List the agorithmic steps to find the cars's mpg (miles per gallon).: 
Step 1 is getting values for gallons used, starting mileage, and ending milage. Step 2 is set the value of distance driven to (ending mileage-starting mileage). Step 3 is set value of average miles per gallon to (distance driven divided by gallons used).
Step 4 is print the value of average miles per gallon.</li>

                     <li> Give a brief overview of Karl Frederich Gauss' mathematics abilities and scientific achievements: Gauss was the first mathematician to construct a 17-sided heptadecagon using a compass and a straight edge, and more importantly was the first to prove the laws of quadratic reciprocity.
                            He is responsible for the prime number theorem. Gauss's work was instrumental to the understanding of algebra, as he proved its central theorem which states that "every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root."
                            One of Gauss's most important contributions to astronomy stemmed from using conic equations to track the dwarf planet Ceres, whose own discoverer Giuseppe Piazzi could not locate it months after its discovery due to the limitations of available tools.
                    </li>
                    <li> Describe  Karl Frederich Gauss' algorithim for adding up numbers from 1 to 100: He had added the numbers in pairs - the first and the last, the second and the second to last and so on, observing that 1+100=101, 2+99=101, 3+98=101, ...so the total would be 50 lots of 101, which is 5050.</li>
                     <li> What are gaussian optics?  a framework for describing optical phenomena, which is based on geometrical optics and the paraxial approximation.</li>
                     <li> What is a "gaussian blur" and how is it used in digital image editing? is the application of a mathematical function to an image in order to blur it.
                            It is used today to remove detail and noise from a photo.
